Julia and I worked on code together. I did the initial push for all of our code but most updates were done by Julia. We communicated
through all our changes, but my computer lacked the computational power to continously test our code. But we remained on the same
page and worked through updates or improvements together, but Julia would run it. We both worked on the notebook as well, discussing
what should be discussed and the details, but I spent a little more time on it since Julia spent a little more on the code, just to
make it more even. We both feel good about the amount of work both of us put in.
