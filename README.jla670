Jooyoung (Julia) Lee
I worked on the development and maintenance of our project’s codebase together with Janet. I implemented the LIME/SHAP interpretability components, and made updates as our project evolved. For each change, I opened a PR so that Janet and I could review and discuss the updates before merging. I also handled most of the execution testing and debugging to ensure everything ran smoothly. I focused mainly on organizing results and offering brief interpretations, while Janet spent more time shaping the written content. Throughout the project, we communicated frequently and worked closely to stay aligned and support each other’s progress.
